The **editor** creates the service.\r\n2. The **publisher** deploys the service online and manages it (configures the service on different publishing environments and manages permissions).\r\n3. The **runner** hosts the part of the service that the end user sees.\r\n4. The **submitter** sends the information entered by a user to the service operator.\r\n\r\nTo create and deploy a service, you’ll need to use the editor and publisher.",
