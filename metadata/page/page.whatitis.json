The **editor** creates the form.\r\n2. The **publisher** deploys the form online and manages it (configures the form on different publishing environments and manages permissions).\r\n3. The **runner** hosts the part of the form that the end user sees.\r\n4. The **submitter** sends the information entered by a user to the operational team who process the completed form.\r\n\r\nTo create and deploy a form, you’ll need to use the editor and publisher.",
