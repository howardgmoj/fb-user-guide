  "body": "Form Builder uses input names to identify each input in your service. \r\n\r\nInput names are not shown to users. They're used just by the editor to refer to other inputs.\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nLet's say you want to only display a particular page to a user based on the answer they gave in a radio list on an earlier page.\r\n\r\nWhen setting the [conditional logic](/validation) on the later page, you'll need to refer back to the radio list from the earlier page.\r\n\r\nTo do that, you'll use the input name of the radio list, usually combined with the [option value](/option-value) of a specific answer in the list.\r\n\r\nInput names:\r\n\r\n- can use letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores - no spaces or special characters\r\n- correspond to the HTML ‘name’ attribute\r\n\r\n## Repeatable components\r\n\r\nIf you're creating repeatable components, just name the [input name](/input-names) once, without a number.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user can 'Add another child', your input name for that repeatable component would be simply 'child'. \r\n\r\nForm Builder will add numbers to each repeatable component automatically.\r\n\r\n## IDs\r\n\r\nForm Builder also uses IDs. \r\n\r\nForm Builder creates these automatically, so you don't need to worry about them.\r\n\r\nIDs are unique identifiers that Form Builder needs to recognise each item, component and page in your service.",
