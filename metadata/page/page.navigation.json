You can edit this page for the service you're building.\r\n\r\nIf you're running the service on port 3000, access the start page at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).\r\n\r\nYou can always quickly get to your start page by clicking:\r\n\r\n* the GOV.UK link (top left)\r\n* your service's name (top centre)\r\n\r\n## Top navigation bar\r\n\r\nThe top blue navigation bar has 6 links.\r\n\r\n### Dashboard\r\n\r\nShows you:\r\n\r\n* the pages in your service\r\n* a link to edit your service details (name, phase etc)\r\n\r\n### Page flow\r\n\r\nA flow diagram of how your service's pages link together.\r\n\r\n### Live view\r\n\r\nShows you how the page will display to a user.\r\n\r\nIf the page or its components contain conditional logic, the page will display (or not) based on answers the user has \r\nalready given.\r\n\r\n### Preview mode\r\n\r\nShows you all the possible contents of the page. For example, if the page has conditional logic to show one of several possible components to any given user, preview mode will show you **all** of the possible components.\r\n\r\nYou'll see an extra navigation bar (light blue) at the top of the screen, allowing you to easily navigate forwards and backwards through your form.\r\n\r\n### Wysiwyg mode\r\n\r\nAn editing mode, similar to preview: it shows all components on a page.\r\n\r\nAllows you to edit each component on the page, by clicking on the pencil (âœŽ) or brackets ('{}') icons on the left.\r\n\r\n### Instance mode\r\n\r\nA 'back end' or 'CMS' editing mode.\r\n\r\nIt allows you to edit all properties that you can edit for a page, component or item, and the raw JSON.",
