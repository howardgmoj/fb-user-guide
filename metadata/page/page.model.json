The user’s inputs would still be saved against unique keys.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nYou create a generic text component to capture full names. You give it the input name ‘fullname’.\r\n\r\nYou could use this on both:\r\n\r\n- a page asking for an applicant’s details\r\n- a page asking for a defendant’s details\r\n\r\nBy giving the defendant’s page the model name ‘defendant’ and the applicant’s page the model name ‘applicant’, the user input would be stored against these keys:\r\n\r\n- defendant.fullname\r\n- applicant.fullname\r\n\r\nIf you protect the model name, you stop it being overwritten by another input name.\r\n\r\nSome components *require* a model name - for example, a repeatable fieldset.",
